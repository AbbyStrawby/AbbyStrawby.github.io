## Contributions

My contributions to this project were in the spell mechanics, boss design, asset production, and level design. This project was made using the MonoGame engine and scripted in C#. The main design feature of all of the spells was that they could be used in any direction, from the player position to the mouse position. I implemented this using simple linear algebra to determine the normalized vector so that all the spells could be cast along that vector. I then worked on developing each of the spells alongside another teammate. The Fire Dash ended up being my favorite to work on, as it allowed the player to quickly move unharmed in any direction of their choosing, damaging any enemy they pass through. As for the boss design, I came up with a lot of the concepts for how their attacks would work, keeping in mind what spell abilities the player would have for each fight. In addition, I also was responsible for the production of all of the assets in the game, including the player, enemies, spells, environment, and more, which I made these using Clip Studio Paint. Our idea for the aesthetic of Soulbinder were that a mojority of the world be shown in greys, but magical things would have vibrant colors. Finally, my biggest overall contribution to the game was in level design. Not only did I implement the game's 36 levels, but I also developed mechanics for obstacles, checkpoints, keys, and more. I built the levels using an external level editor made by another team member in Windows Forms. Then, after loading the level into the game I would add all the mechanics I had in mind for each level, such as rocks that fell and damaged the player, or a room where you needed to defeat all of the enemies to escape, with enemies spawning in waves.
