Assemble your squad before your friends to be the top dog in the Neon Junkyard. Pass the Pain is a cyberpunk hidden objective card game where played cards get redistributed and stay in the game. Your goal is to get sets of cards specified by your objective card while avoiding the notorious Glitch card, which will cost you points if it's in your hand when the game ends. Play cards to activate their effects or place them down to lock in one of your objectives. Complete all your objectives and you might just win it all.

## Breakdown

It’s the year 2117 in a city under the tyrannical rule of the Jha’do Corporation. Jha’do Co. likes to call the place Neo Justice City, but the rest of us know it as the Neon Junkyard. With few resources and fierce competition, it takes a lot to stand out around here. Think you got what it takes to be top dog in the Neon Junkyard? Then get ready to assemble the biggest, baddest squad around. Recruit interesting characters into your squad– just beware the Glitch, a notorious and mysterious force of the Jha’do Corporation, who will try to sabotage your efforts. Take your rightful place at the top by passing some pain to rival squads.

## Cards

Cards are broken up into types. There are 7 types: Rookie, Cyborg, Digitone, Firewall, Hacker, Ninja, and Glitch. The main types have levels from 1-3, with lower level cards being common and having weaker effects and higher level cards being rarer having stronger types. Rookie and Glitch type cards are special, as they don't have levels and com in different frequencies. Rookie type cards don't have much impact but can be helpful. Glitch type cards have a negative effect inflicted on the player when that card leaves their hand (whether by playing it or otherwise being removed). Additionally, Glitch type cards result in losing points for any player with one in their hand. Here are some examples of other types of card:

Choose one card at random from each and swap them."](/conf/projects/PassThePain/hack1.png "Hacker!!!!! :3") ![A level 2 Digitone type card labeled "For My Next Song." Its effect reads "Mimic the effect of the last card played." The text "Reaction!" appears at the bottom.](/conf/projects/PassThePain/digi2.png "What a lovely voice") ![A Glitch type card featuring a question mark in place of a level labeled "Go Phish." Its effect reads "When this card is removed from your hand, you must pass 2 additional cards."](/conf/projects/PassThePain/glitch.png "oooo spooky")

## Objective

You need to complete the 4 objectives on your Objective Card to end the game. When the game ends, players count up how many objectives they have completed and subtract the number of glitches in their hand from that. The player with the highest score wins!

## Project Takeaways

Working on this project required a lot communication, creativity, and most importantly playtesting. Pass the Pain's main feature of distributing played cards back to the players is very unique, but also difficult to grasp, so we had to be sure we were testing often and with new people to make sure we could get valuable feedback on both how fun and how clear our game mechanics were. We took our feedback and used it to address what aspects of gameplay most needed our attention: What did we need to change? To add? To remove? It was important to make sure we didn't get too attached to any one idea, because doing so would hinder out ability to make decisions and discovery that led to improving the game. Communicating with my fellow designers allowed us to iterate on the ideas of our game quickly, so we were able to try out new abilities and mechanics to get feedback on what worked and what didn't.
