Assemble your squad before your friends to be the top dog in the Neon Junkyard. Pass the Pain is a cyberpunk hidden objective card game where played cards get redistributed and stay in the game. Your goal is to get the cards specified by your objectives while avoiding the notorious Glitch card, which will cost you points if it's in your hand when the game ends. Play cards to activate their effects or place them down to lock in one of your objectives. Complete all your objectives and you might just win it all.

It’s the year 2117 in a city under the tyrannical rule of the Jha’do Corporation. Jha’do Co. likes to call the place Neo Justice City, but the rest of us know it as the Neon Junkyard. With few resources and fierce competition, it takes a lot to stand out around here. Think you got what it takes to be top dog in the Neon Junkyard? Then get ready to assemble the biggest, baddest squad around. Recruit interesting characters into your squad– just beware the Glitch, a notorious and mysterious force of the Jha’do Corporation, who will try to sabotage your efforts. Take your rightful place at the top by passing some pain to rival squads.

Cards are broken up into types. There are 7 types: Rookie, Cyborg, Digitone, Firewall, Hacker, Ninja, and Glitch. The main types have levels from 1-3, with lower level cards being common and having weaker effects and higher level cards being rarer having stronger types. Rookie and Glitch type cards are special, as they don't have levels and com in different frequencies. Rookie type cards don't have much impact but can be helpful. Glitch type cards have a negative effect inflicted on the player when that card leaves their hand (whether by playing it or otherwise being removed). Additionally, Glitch type cards result in losing points for any player with one in their hand. Here are some examples of other types of card:

![A level 3 Cyborg type card labeled "Satisfactory Reset." Its effect reads "Put up to 4 cards from your hand into the Pass Pile. Draw that number of cards. A Glitch immune symbol appears at the bottom.](/conf/projects/PassThePain/cy3.png "A suave, cybernetic guy")

You need to complete the 4 objectives on your Objective Card to end the game. When the game ends, players count up how many objectives they have completed and subtract the number of glitches in their hand from that. The player with the highest score wins!
