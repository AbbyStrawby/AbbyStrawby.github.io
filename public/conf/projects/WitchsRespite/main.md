Experience a moment of quiet in this quaint witch's potion shop. Witch's Respite is an interactive art display, showcasing the 3D models that make up this potion shop.

## Process

- Gathered reference images for the kind of area/aesthetic I wanted to create
- Drew in Clip Studio Paint a top-down diagram of both floors of the shop with all of items arranged
- Began using Maya to make models for the objects and the shop, making increasingly complicated models
- Greyboxed the entire shop in Unity, where the project would all come together, with a first person character controller to get a feel for the space in 3 dimensions
- Created a UV map for the models in Maya so that I could then use Substance Painter 3D to design textures for them
- Arranged the finished 3D models in Unity, later adding the textures as well
- Added finishing touches like lighting, particle effects, and subtle movement to enhance the atmosphere
