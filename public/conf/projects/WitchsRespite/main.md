## Process

This was the final project in my 3D modeling class. We were tasked with creating an environment filled entirely with models we create. After deciding to depict a witch's potion shop and creating a diagram for the layout of the room, I began making the models. I did so using Maya, using primitive shapes as a base and then modifying them in increasingly complex ways to design the models I wanted. I ended up with a total of 15 different models, far more than was require for the project. As I modeled, I began using Unity to outline the environment using greyboxing to flesh out the layout of the shop in a 3D space, using a built in first person character controller to explore the space. Once all the models were complete, including one for the shop itself, I using Substance Painter 3D to assign textures to the UV map I created for each model. As I did that, I started replacing things in the greybox with the models. Once the textures were done, those were added onto all of the models, and final changes were made with lighting and particles to complete the scene.
