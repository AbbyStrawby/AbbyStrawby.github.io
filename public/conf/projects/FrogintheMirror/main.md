Get ready to leap into action in this 2D puzzle platformer. You play as Kipper, a Spriggan from the world of Ethshar. Solve puzzles using his frog-like movement to find powerful magical talismans that enhance the way you interact with the world.

## Personal Contributions

- Held brainstorming sessions with teammates to blend together our ideas for movement and puzzle mechanics
- Programmed in the Godot game engine using both C# and GDScript to implement gameplay features
- Designed and developed the grapple as the main means of interacting with other mechanics: pulling objects, launching the player, and activating switches
- Conducted frequent playtesting to see what features we should focus on in future sprints
- Implemented features to improve the feel of the game, such as coyote time for jumps and freeze frames when the grapple hits something
- Created the game's early levels to showcase new mechanics being added to the game for playtesting
- Arranged meetings to discuss the state of the game including how we wanted to proceed and what ideas we needed to leave behind
- Designed the final versions of levels by making a molecule graph and level layout sketches before implementing them in game

## Takeaways

I'm always looking to learn new engines and tools, so when deciding what engine to use, I pushed my team to try Godot, an engine none of us had any experience in. I was delighted while familiarizing myself with the way the engine operates, as scenes and signals were quite intuitive to use. Working in Godot was a worthwhile experience that allowed me to showcase how quickly I can pick up a new engine to start working on a project. 

Additionally, this project was the first time I got to employ the skills and techniques I learned in my level design class. First I thought of different sequences and moments I wanted the player to have, laying them out in a list. I took that list and made a molecule graph to visualize the connections between those events. Next I drew out sketches of the level to get an idea of the layout and space. Finally, I implemented those levels in the game making changes and tweaks as necessary. Working on this has made me realize I have a passion designing levels for games.
