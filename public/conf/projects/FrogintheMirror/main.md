Get ready to leap into action in this 2D puzzle platformer. You play as Kipper, a Spriggan from the world of Ethshar. Solve puzzles using his frog-like movement to find powerful magical talismans that enhance the way he interacts with the world.

Frog in the Mirror is an upcoming team project, being worked on by Kirby Saligo, Sam Castle, Abby Doskey, Edward Wheaton, and Chenyu Yang. Check back for more updates as we progress.
